2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.158 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.457 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.542 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.897 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.936 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/en_reg/D (clocked by clk_slow_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
